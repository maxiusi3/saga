# ⚡ Skip Step 2 - Policy Already Exists

## Good News!

The error means the policies for `user_resource_wallets` already exist. This is actually good - it means the table and policies are already set up correctly!

## ✅ What to Do

**Skip Step 2** and continue with Step 3.

## Quick Check

Run this to see what's already done:

```sql
-- Check existing tables
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('user_settings', 'user_resource_wallets', 'projects', 'project_members', 'stories')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check existing policies
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

## What You'll See

If you see:
- `user_settings` - ✅ Created (Step 1)
- `user_resource_wallets` - ✅ Already exists (Skip Step 2)

Then you should:
1. ✅ Skip Step 2
2. ➡️ Go to Step 3 (projects)
3. ➡️ Continue from there

## Alternative: Drop and Recreate

If you want to recreate Step 2 cleanly:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own wallet" ON user_resource_wallets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own wallet" ON user_resource_wallets;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own wallet" ON user_resource_wallets;

-- Now run Step 2 again
```

## Recommended Action

**Just skip Step 2 and continue with Step 3!**

The table and policies are already there, which is fine.
