# Project Page Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Manage Project Button - Owner Only Access
**Issue**: The "Manage Project" button was visible to all users regardless of ownership status.

**Fix**: Added conditional rendering based on `project.is_owner`:
```tsx
{project.is_owner && (
  <Link href={`/dashboard/projects/${projectId}/settings`}>
    <EnhancedButton variant="outline" size="sm">
      <Users className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
      Manage Project
    </EnhancedButton>
  </Link>
)}
```

**Result**: Only project owners can now see and access the "Manage Project" button, regardless of their role (facilitator or storyteller).

### 2. Removed Demo Chapter Data
**Issue**: The page displayed demo/mock data for "Chapter: Early Years in Mexico" which was not real data.

**Fix**: Removed the entire chapter summary card section:
- Removed the EnhancedCard showing "Chapter: Early Years in Mexico"
- Removed the demo description about Rosa's childhood memories
- Removed the "5 Stories • Dec 2023 - Jan 2024" metadata

**Result**: The page now only shows real data from the database, with no mock/demo content.

## Access Control Logic

### Manage Project Button Visibility
- ✅ Shows when: `project.is_owner === true`
- ❌ Hidden when: `project.is_owner === false`
- Independent of user role (facilitator/storyteller)

### Record New Story Button Visibility
- Controlled by `ActionPermissionGate` with `canCreateStories` permission
- ✅ Shows for: Storytellers
- ❌ Hidden for: Facilitators (unless they are also storytellers)

## Testing Checklist
