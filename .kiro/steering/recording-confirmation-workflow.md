# Recording Confirmation Workflow Implementation Guide

## Overview

The v1.5 recording confirmation workflow introduces a "Review & Send" step that allows Storytellers to review their recordings before sending them to family members. This enhances user confidence and reduces recording anxiety.

## Core Workflow

### Recording States
1. **Recording**: User is actively recording
2. **Review**: User can play back, re-record, or confirm
3. **Confirmed**: Recording is sent to family and processed
4. **Draft**: Recording saved locally but not sent (for recovery)

### User Journey
```
Start Recording → Stop Recording → Review Screen → Send to Family → Success
                                      ↓
                                 Re-record/Delete
```

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Draft Management
```typescript
interface LocalRecordingDraft {
  sessionId: string
  userId: string
  projectId: string
  localAudioUri: string  // Local file path
  duration: number
  localPhotoUri?: string
  createdAt: Date
}

class RecordingDraftService {
  async saveDraft(draft: LocalRecordingDraft): Promise<void>
  async recoverDraft(userId: string): Promise<LocalRecordingDraft | null>
  async discardDraft(sessionId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Storage Strategy
- **MMKV Storage**: Fast, synchronous key-value storage for drafts
- **Local File System**: Audio and photo files stored locally until confirmed
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Drafts cleaned up after successful send or manual deletion

### Review Screen Components
- **Audio Playback**: Waveform visualization with play/pause controls
- **Duration Display**: Clear indication of recording length
- **Quality Indicators**: Visual feedback on audio quality
- **Action Buttons**: "Send to Family", "Re-record", "Delete"

## User Experience Guidelines

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Large Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44dp for all interactive elements
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Prominent "Send to Family" button
- **Screen Reader Support**: Comprehensive accessibility labels
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast mode

### Confirmation Flow
- **Clear Messaging**: "Send to Family" creates emotional connection
- **Success Feedback**: Immediate confirmation with family notification
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of upload failures with retry options

### Draft Recovery
- **App Launch Check**: Automatically detect and offer to recover drafts
- **User Choice**: Clear options to "Resume Uploading" or "Delete"
- **No Data Loss**: Ensure recordings are never lost due to app crashes

## Performance Considerations

### File Management
- **Compression**: Optimize audio files for upload while maintaining quality
- **Progressive Upload**: Show upload progress with ability to cancel
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed uploads with exponential backoff

### Memory Management
- **Efficient Playback**: Use native audio players to minimize memory usage
- **File Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- **Storage Monitoring**: Alert users if device storage is low

## Analytics & Metrics

### Key Metrics
- **Review Completion Rate**: % of recordings that proceed from review to send
- **Re-record Rate**: % of recordings that are re-recorded after review
- **Draft Recovery Rate**: % of drafts successfully recovered after app crashes
- **Upload Success Rate**: % of confirmed recordings successfully uploaded

### User Behavior Insights
- **Review Duration**: How long users spend reviewing recordings
- **Quality Satisfaction**: Correlation between recording quality and send rate
- **Error Recovery**: How users respond to upload failures

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Upload Failure**: Network issues during upload
- **Storage Full**: Device storage insufficient for recording
- **App Crash**: Recovery of in-progress recordings
- **Audio Quality**: Poor audio quality detection and user guidance

### Recovery Strategies
```typescript
class RecordingErrorHandler {
  async handleUploadFailure(draft: LocalRecordingDraft): Promise<void> {
    // Show retry options with different strategies
    // - Retry immediately
    // - Retry when on WiFi
    // - Save for later
  }
  
  async handleStorageIssues(): Promise<void> {
    // Guide user to free up space
    // Offer to compress existing recordings
    // Suggest cloud backup options
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Draft save/recovery logic
- Audio playback functionality
- File management operations
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end recording workflow
- Cross-platform draft synchronization
- Upload retry mechanisms
- Storage cleanup processes

### User Testing
- Accessibility with real users
- Recording anxiety reduction validation
- Error recovery user experience
- Performance on various devices

## Security Considerations

### Local Storage Security
- **Encryption**: Encrypt draft files on device
- **Access Control**: Restrict file access to app only
- **Cleanup**: Secure deletion of temporary files

### Upload Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All uploads over secure connections
- **Authentication**: Verify user identity before upload
- **File Validation**: Validate file integrity and format

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Editing Tools**: Basic audio editing (trim, volume)
- **Multiple Takes**: Record multiple versions and choose best
- **Transcription Preview**: Show AI transcript during review
- **Quality Enhancement**: AI-powered audio improvement

### Analytics Integration
- **Detailed Metrics**: Track user behavior patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Test different review screen layouts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track upload success rates and timing
