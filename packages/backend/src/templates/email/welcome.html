        <p><strong>1. Start with one family member:</strong> Invite a parent or grandparent to share their stories. They'll receive simple prompts to guide their storytelling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Use the mobile app:</strong> Stories are easiest to record on mobile devices. Your family members can download the Saga app and record stories anywhere, anytime.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3. Engage with stories:</strong> Ask follow-up questions and leave comments to encourage more storytelling and create deeper connections.</p>
