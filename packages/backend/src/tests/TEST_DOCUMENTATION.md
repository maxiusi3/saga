# Comprehensive Test Suite Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive test suite implemented for Task 8.1 of the Saga Family Biography v1.5 MVP. The test suite ensures >80% code coverage and validates all critical functionality across unit, integration, performance, security, accessibility, and end-to-end testing categories.

## Test Organization

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component and service testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Cross-component workflow testing
3. **Performance Tests** - Load and response time validation
4. **Security Tests** - Vulnerability and access control testing
5. **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
6. **End-to-End Tests** - Complete user journey testing

- **Sustained Load**: 30-second continuous load test

### Performance Metrics
- Success rate > 95% for all operations
- Memory usage increase < 50MB during load tests
- No memory leaks during repeated operations
- Requests per second > 5 RPS under sustained load

## Security Test Coverage

### Authentication Security
- JWT token validation and expiry
- Password strength requirements
- OAuth provider integration security
- Session management security

### Authorization Testing
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Project-specific permissions
- Resource ownership validation
- API endpoint access control

### Input Validation
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS attack prevention
- File upload security
- Request size limits

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- Sensitive data handling
- Error message information leakage
- Rate limiting effectiveness

## Accessibility Test Coverage

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- Text alternatives for audio content
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast requirements
- Focus management
- Error identification and description

### API Accessibility Features
- Structured data for assistive technologies
- Meaningful error messages

- Consistent response formats
- Duration information for media content

### Mobile Accessibility
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns
- Appropriate response sizes
- Mobile-specific accessibility features

## End-to-End Test Scenarios

### Complete User Journeys
1. **Facilitator Journey**
   - Sign up → Create project → Invite storyteller → View stories → Add interactions → Export data

2. **Multi-Facilitator Collaboration**
   - Multiple facilitators → Shared project → Collaborative interactions → Attribution verification

3. **Recording Confirmation Workflow**
   - Storyteller onboarding → Prompt delivery → Recording → Review & Send → Facilitator feedback

4. **Archival Mode Workflow**
   - Active project → Subscription expiry → Archival transition → Read-only access → Export functionality

5. **Error Recovery**
   - Invalid requests → Error handling → Recovery → Successful operations

## Test Data Management

### Test Database
- Isolated test database (saga_test)
- Automatic cleanup between test runs
- Seed data for consistent testing
- Transaction rollback for unit tests

### Mock Services

- Email service mocking
- Push notification mocking
- File upload simulation

### Test Users and Projects
- Predefined test user accounts
- Sample project data
- Test story content
- Mock audio/image files

## Running the Test Suite
